This study endeavors to illustrate the calibration process of the Heath-Jarrow-Morton (HJM) model, with a specific focus on German power swaps throughout the monitoring period spanning the fourth quarter of 2024. Initially, comprehensive details pertaining to the model and its dynamics will be provided. Subsequently, we will explore the admissible conditions for the model parameters to ensure that forward prices exhibit martingale properties.
Following this, the calibration process will commence by optimizing the parameters based on option prices. The objective is to minimize the disparity between model-derived prices and observed market prices.
